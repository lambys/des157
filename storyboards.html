      <p> in this storyboard i focus on a UC davis student who is feeling
      lost in finding their place in their community. they want to
     have an interaction with others but they are averted to big groups
   or joining clubs. this site provides them with a way to both identify
 themselves through self-expression and to visualize the diversity of their
community.
my feedback for this storyboard was that the input is a bit vague,
it is not clear what or how the user inputs, and the result was
also confusing to them.</p>


  <h2>storyboard 2</h2>

      <p>
      therefore, with the second storyboard, i listened to the feedback by making
      the method of input more clear as a drop-down menu rather than a text
      input, and that they are engaging directly with their community. the choices
      that they make correspond to a visual input on the planet forms. i wanted it
      to be more clear that their motivation is the activity of other fellow students
      and the end result is visualizing the beauty of the
      diversity of their community and their unique place in it.
