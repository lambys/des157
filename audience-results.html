    <h2> audience test results </h2>
    <p>As a whole, audience testing was an incredibly helpful process that I am grateful to integrate into my final product. Each tester provided unique perspectives on my project that I hadn’t yet thought of, that I am interested in exploring further.</p>  <p>Bryan was my first user tester, and therefore was most helpful in identifying those initial usability issues that I hadn’t yet confronted, partly due to the site’s prototype state. I noticed that while the customization process was generally smooth, the galaxy screen was extremely confusing. The events calendar does not open in a new window, and since my site is built on event listeners instead of separate HTML pages for each step, this resulted in the user having to restart the whole process of making their planet upon hitting the back button from the external site. Another aspect of this page in particular that is confusing is currently how the text information of each community changes. It is an event listener attached to the dropdown menu at the moment that will only change the text upon a mouseover. This was not only confusing for Bryan but for all three of my users.</p>  <p>Bryan’s feedback revolved around this final page— he felt like he was waiting for something more to happen due to the “now viewing” phrasing. Once he completed the customization process there was not much to do, other than the event calendar, which restarted the whole thing. Currently the group sections of the galaxy makes selecting your personal groups seem redundant, but this is an issue I was aware of and intended to fix in a future iteration. Bryan also mentioned a key phrasing issue, especially with my target audience being Davis students, that while students may live in Davis for school they are not technically residents of the city. He was engaged by the particle star system in the background but overall did not have much to do once he created his planet.</p>

<p>Tara was my second user tester, and though Bryan provided me with the majority of the observational usability issues, it emphasized again to me how discouraging the reset of the planet the user created upon the event calendar link really was. Tara provided me with some great feedback, most notably that she felt like her objective and purpose were unclear. She suggested that since the final page seemed rather empty and also had little difference between each community, to either include symbols for each community or reform the ability for a user to choose a planet or a star into a star for each community that the planets revolve around. Instead of the external link for the events calendar, Tara suggested a library that can pull data from other sites, which would be ideal. She also suggested Firebase as a means of storing user data which I am looking into. In terms of additional communities, Tara suggested a grad student option or the ability to suggest communities. She also had some confusion with my phrasing, “place” made her expect to see a map of the communities, and was confused by how it would be “represented”. </p>

<p>Rocket was my final user tester, which was incredibly helpful for a target audience perspective since I was intending for the age bracket to begin at his age. It also gave me a perspective of someone that does not attend UC Davis. Rocket, like Tara and Bryan, experienced the frustration of the external link resetting the page. He provided some key suggestions, to consider rearranging the text on the final page which can be misleading and grammatically confusing. Rocket was helpful in regards to how he interpreted the welcome screen text as well, noting the implications of “place” and “community,” and most notably how I could work to make the communities intersectional, especially considering that most people likely apply to multiple communities. He wanted more interaction on the final stage, suggesting even something as simple as seeing what events other users checked on the community page. An eye opening way that Rocket suggested in making the communities intersectional and overlap was, instead of planets for each community, to actually have a different planetary body for each community, visualized in a single galaxy, such as planets, comets, moons, and stars representing the four communities. </p>
  <p>Ultimately, Rocket’s suggestion of a different planetary body for each community is something I’d really like to pursue, but I am not sure if I will have sufficient time, because I will have to reconstruct the fundamentals of my code. However, I believe that that would not only make my objective more clear but would also be much more visually engaging. In general, my final page needs a huge reform after getting this user feedback and observation. I want to pursue Tara’s idea of displaying the event calendar with a library that hosts data from other sites instead of an external link, which can be jarring. </p>
