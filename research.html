      <h2>background research</h2>
      <p> Visualizing diversity in an interactive system is my primary goal for this project. In other words, to portray the different qualities and characteristics that make up individuals in a community, or simply within the pool of users, and how there
        is beauty in a diverse visual system. And often, how the community, group, ecosystem, etc. cannot function without the contribution of each of these unique components. I sought out instances of the concept of visualizing diversity being executed,
        since it can manage to be a daunting task depending on how you approach gathering and expressing the collected data of each individual. In Tuan Pham’s dissertation, “What Does Diversity Look Like?” this concept is broken down into core aspects,
        what makes it difficult, and how they specifically approached it. Pham mentions the ideal portrayal of as many qualities as possible in a visual system like this, in this case, they examined the diversity of an incoming freshman class. It is indicated
        that as the number of attributes or objects displayed in the system increase, it becomes more difficult to organize effectively. However, Pham notes that not much has been done to establish an effective formula for visually expressing a multitude
        of characteristics in a data set. The way they approached it utilized multiple colors for the diversity of characteristics, and opacity for the density or the amount of people that each attribute applied to. The result is a relatively easy to
        digest “patchwork” style visualization. </p>

        From a biological science perspective, visualizing the diversity of organisms or species in an ecosystem parallels this concept in that each populations’ unique characteristics depend on one another, and cannot survive without their diversity. In his
        work, Zachary Foster noticed that the tendency for taxonomic diversity data to be visualized was through tables, bar graphs, or pie charts. Foster felt that these visualizations were restricted by their limitations of color as the sole differentiation
        between categories. He developed a method of visualizing this data more as a connected branch, visualizing how each population branches out from one another with color and opacity indicating other attributes of the individual species. In this
        way, the diversity of these ecosystems are expressed much more accurately and visually arresting.</p>

      <p>Another application of the benefit of effective visual diversity is in the quality of user interface design in general, and how it engages its audience. Aliaksei Miniukovich examines this in his research of how users responded to apps or website
        layouts with low to high visual diversity, in the sense of range of colors, opacity, textures, hierarchy, and a generally captivating UI that encouraged interaction. The effectiveness of the visual diversity in each site or app the users interacted
        with directly correlated to the users’ likelihood to return, the duration they remained on the site or app, and so on. While Miniukovich was not visualizing a data set of a diverse population, his study remains relevant to my research in that
        the bar graphs, tables and pie charts typically used to demonstrate the diversity of a community are not reflective of the attributes themselves, and are often bland and hard to digest. </p>

      <p>Ultimately, visualizing diversity faces two major obstacles across all disciplines: limitations by the method of data expression itself (ex. bar graphs, pie charts) which cannot accurately express the myriad of attributes in a community, and the
        graphic design itself in terms of use of color, opacity, and branching to indicate how these characteristics are related, the density of individuals in within each attribute, and the variety of attributes overall.
