      <h2>project brief</h2>

<p>
  In my final project based upon the topic of “diversity,” I intend to go about it from a visual perspective. I wanted the user to be able to visualize the diversity of their community in a unique and captivating way, and to also tackle the realm of self-expression
  as well. After debating upon what kind of visual system to represent each individual with, I decided upon an interactive galaxy, where each user on the website customizes either a planet or a star to represent themselves after choosing which community
  they identify with. Once the user creates a fitting reflection of themselves, they can zoom out to the full scope of the previous users’ choices to both visualize the beauty of the diversity in their community, the similarities they also share with
  others, and their own individual place in it all. I want it to be a grounding, meditative experience of both self-reflection and connection with others. The experience will be mostly self-guided, with the connection with others being able to view other
  users’ choices manifested in the galaxy.
</p>
<p>
  My target audience is primarily students and on the younger demographic range, especially college students who may feel isolated from moving alone to a new community that is actually more diverse and vibrant than they might think. My age range is therefore
  around 10-25, with a focus on the 18-25 college age range. Since my goal is to represent a diverse group of people, I intend for the backgrounds and characteristics of each person to be from a wide range. The primary aspect I want to target in this
  case is age, and preferably a college student.
</p>
<p>
  The users will begin by choosing an applicable community to them, ranging from specific to broad (ex. design majors, third-year students, UC Davis students, Davis residents, and so on). The user can also add themselves to multiple communities if they
  wish. After they have made their community selection, the user will choose from several preset options to customize either a planet or a star with qualities that reflect their favorite things, interests, or qualities about themselves translated into
  a visual aspect of the planet or star. Once complete, the user can then view the full visual system of their community, and visualize the beauty of each of these communities they identify with as well as their individual contribution.
</p>
<p>
  It will be clear at each step what exactly the user is choosing, at first with a brief introduction motivating the user to try to visualize their community before the process. This makes it evident that the end goal of this process is to be able to appreciate
  and see yourself and your peers in a transformative way.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, I want the website to have a soft, comforting aesthetic with warm pinks, purples, and cream colors. I intend to use the Google font VT323 to mimic the vibe of video games, and to make it feel generally more playful and interactive. I want this
  sense of play, comfort, and meditation to be obvious to the user from the color scheme, type choice, and even art style of the planets and stars in the galaxies themselves.
