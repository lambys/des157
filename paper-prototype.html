<p> my first prototype was approached the interface from a simple event-based sequence, where each decision the user
must make takes them to a new window. this was mostly straightforward to my tester until the last
squence, where after customizing their planet, the user can then view themselves in their
community galaxy. the confusion arose from the "view another" prompt, which would then
allow them to view another galaxy they may or may not apply to, or to start over and
return to the first selection screen. </p>

<p>therefore, in my second prototype, i not only gave the user more opportunities
to go back to the previous selection but i wanted to specify the end result screen
by allowing the user to navigate through communities through a drop-down menu.
in this way, whether or not the user is part of that community, it is obvious
that they can view it or choose to add themselves by clicking on start over.</p>
